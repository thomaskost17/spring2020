# MATLAB Portion of Homework 1

This section outlines the work done for problem 6 of the Homework 1. This probelem is focused on implementing the perceptron algorithm.

## MATLAB Code 

The following code is the code implementing the perceptron algorithm for problem 6. Note that the code is commented to designate which parts are relevant to each section of the problem.

## MATLAB Results and Answers

All generated plots are shown here. The plots are labeled with the part with which they correspond. Note that the answers to each question are also listed here. This portion of th file is broken up by part so the relevant answers and graphs will be under each listed part.

### 6a:

We plotted the three data sets the results are shown below in figures 1,2, and 3. 
We can see from the plots that data sets 1 and 2 are both linearly seperable. This is beacuse these two sets form two clear clusters that do not overlap with one another. This means that these groupings can be divided by a simple linear boundry. As a result they are linearly seperable. We can compare this to data set 3, where the two clusters clearly overlap one another. In this case the groups cannot be simply determined by a linear boundary/inequality.
